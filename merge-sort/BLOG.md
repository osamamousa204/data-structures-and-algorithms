In the second pass through of the selection sort, we evaluate if the previous number before arr[2] in the array than what is currently present in index 2. We find that the previous number is not acually  smaller than the number in index 2 so we didn't do the switch.
3. pass 3 :
In the third pass through of the selection sort, we evaluate if the previous number before arr[3] in the array than what is currently present in index 3. We find that the previous number is not acually  smaller than the number in index 3 so we didn't do the switch.
4. pass 4 :
In the forth pass through of the selection sort, we evaluate if the previous number before arr[4] wich is 8 in the array than what is currently present in index 4. We find that the previous number is acually is smaller than the number in index 4 so we switch them.
