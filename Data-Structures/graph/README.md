# Graph
## 401 challenges
## Challenge
- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

**`AddNode()`**:
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
**`AddEdge()`**:
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3.**`GetNodes()`**: Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
**`GetNeighbors()`**:
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
**`Size()`** :
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
